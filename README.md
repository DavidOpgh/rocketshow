# Rocket Show
An app to play shows including audio, video, lighting (e.g. DMX) and MIDI.

## For developers
### Development
#### Build
1. Build the Java JAR: `mvn install`
2. Start the backend server: `java -jar rocketshow.jar`
3. Start web frontend server: `cd src/main/webapp && npx ng serve`

Check the state of the backend: http://localhost:8080/api/system/state \
Open the web application: http://localhost:4200

### Deployment
#### Seed directory
The seed directory structure '/dist/rocketshow' can be packed on a mac with this commands (assuming you're currently in the 'dist' directory):
```shell
COPYFILE_DISABLE=true tar -c --exclude='.DS_Store' -zf directory.tar.gz rocketshow
```

#### Image building
This script is used to build the image (may take about 45 minutes). Preparation should be done according to the readme in the GIT repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RPi-distro/pi-gen.git
cd pi-gen
git checkout tags/2018-03-13-raspbian-stretch

echo "IMG_NAME='RocketShow'" > config

touch ./stage3/SKIP ./stage4/SKIP ./stage5/SKIP
rm stage4/EXPORT* stage5/EXPORT*

# Enhance stage2 with rocketshow
mkdir ./stage2/99-rocket-show

cat <<'EOF' >./stage2/99-rocket-show/00-run-chroot.sh
#!/bin/bash
#
cd /tmp
wget https://rocketshow.net/install/script/raspbian.sh
chmod +x raspbian.sh
./raspbian.sh
rm -rf raspbian.sh

# Give the setup some time during image creation, because umount won't work afterwards if called
# too fast ("umount: device is busy")
echo "Wait 30 seconds..."
sleep 30s
EOF

chmod +x ./stage2/99-rocket-show/00-run-chroot.sh

./build.sh
```

#### Update process
- Add the release notes in update/currentversion2.xml and build the war ("mvn install")
- Copy seed directory directory.tar.gz to rocketshow.net/install, if updated
- Copy target/rocketshow.jar to rocketshow.net/update/rocketshow.jar
- Copy install/*.sh scripts to rocketshow.net/install/script/*.sh, if updated
- Copy update/currentversion2.xml to rocketshow.net/update/currentversion2.xml
- Copy update/before.sh, update/after.sh to rocketshow.net/update/xy.sh, if updated
- Copy the new complete image to rocketshow.net/install/images and change the file latest.php to link the new version
- GIT merge DEV branch to MASTER
- GIT tag with the current version
- Switch to DEV and update POM and update/currentversion2.xml versions
- Set a new version in the file WebContent/index.jsp -> url=app?v=x.y to prevent Chrome from caching the app's index.html.

#### Application
The built application should be uploaded to rocketshow.net/update and be named "rocketshow.jar". The file "currentversion2.xml" can be modified accordingly.

#### Installation on a Raspberry Pi
These commands can be used to install Rocket Show on a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Lite installed:
```shell
sudo su - root
cd /tmp
wget https://rocketshow.net/install/script/raspbian.sh
chmod +x raspbian.sh
./raspbian.sh
rm -rf raspbian.sh
```
