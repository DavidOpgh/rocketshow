# Rocket Show
An app to play shows including audio, video, lighting (e.g. DMX) and MIDI.

## For developers
### Development
#### Build
1. Build the Java JAR: `mvn install`
2. Start the backend server: `java -jar rocketshow.jar`
3. Start web frontend server: `cd src/main/webapp && npx ng serve`

Check the state of the backend: http://localhost:8080/api/system/state \
Open the web application: http://localhost:4200

### Deployment
#### Seed directory
The seed directory structure '/dist/rocketshow' can be packed on a mac with this commands (assuming you're currently in the 'dist' directory):
```shell
COPYFILE_DISABLE=true tar -c --exclude='.DS_Store' -zf directory.tar.gz rocketshow
```

#### Raspberry Pi Image building
These steps describe how to build a Raspberry Pi image based on the DietPi distribution on a Mac OS X.

1. Flash an image with DietPi 6.17 ARMv6-Stretch to an SD card.
2. Remove the card from the Mac and add it again.
3. There should now be a directory /Volumes/boot available
4. Execute the shell script dist/install/prepare_dietpi_raspberry_image.sh
5. This script prepared the configuration for Rocket Show.
6. Safely remove the SD card and use a Raspberry Pi *connected to the internet* to boot it. According to DietPi, unfortunately there is currently no possibility to build the image without a Raspberry Pi.
7. Let the Raspberry Pi finish its boot process and install all required software. It should shutdown as soon as it's finished.
8. Add the SD card back to the Mac.
9. Find its drive name with diskutil ```list```.
10. Unmount the disk. E.g. ```diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2```.
11. Create an image of the card. E.g. ```sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/Users/vio/sdcard.img bs=512```.
12. Transfer the image to a Linux (e.g. VirtualBox), because gparted is needed for the next steps.
13. Use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drewsif/PiShrink/master/pishrink.sh to shrink the image.
14. Zip the image using ```gzip -9 rocketshow.img```.

#### Update process
- Add the release notes in update/currentversion2.xml and build the war ("mvn install")
- Copy seed directory directory.tar.gz to rocketshow.net/install, if updated
- Copy target/rocketshow.jar to rocketshow.net/update/rocketshow.jar
- Copy install/*.sh scripts to rocketshow.net/install/script/*.sh, if updated
- Copy update/currentversion2.xml to rocketshow.net/update/currentversion2.xml
- Copy update/before.sh, update/after.sh to rocketshow.net/update/xy.sh, if updated
- Copy the new complete image to rocketshow.net/install/images and change the file latest.php to link the new version
- GIT merge DEV branch to MASTER
- GIT tag with the current version
- Switch to DEV and update POM and update/currentversion2.xml versions
- Set a new version in the file WebContent/index.jsp -> url=app?v=x.y to prevent Chrome from caching the app's index.html.

#### Application
The built application should be uploaded to rocketshow.net/update and be named "rocketshow.jar". The file "currentversion2.xml" can be modified accordingly.

#### Installation on a Raspberry Pi
These commands can be used to install Rocket Show on a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Lite installed:
```shell
sudo su - root
cd /tmp
wget https://rocketshow.net/install/script/raspbian.sh
chmod +x raspbian.sh
./raspbian.sh
rm -rf raspbian.sh
```
You should reboot after installing Rocket Show.
